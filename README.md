Go Challenge Submission
=====

Submission for the [Go Challenge](http://golang-challenge.com/go-challenge1/).

I implemented my solution for Python 2.7. You can run the test suite by
executing `python -m unittest discover` while in the same directory as this
readme; this should run the five test cases. If you have any questions, or
issues just shoot me an email.
